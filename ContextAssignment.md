**Connection to Student Outcomes**

ABET has identified the following student outcomes for engineering programs.  This assignment relates to outcomes g through j, shown below in *italics*.  

(a) an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering  
(b) an ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data  
(c) an ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability  
(d) an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams  
(e) an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems  
(f) an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility  
*(g) an ability to communicate effectively**  
*(h) the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context**  
*(i) a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning**  
*(j) a knowledge of contemporary issues**  
(k) an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice.

Broadly, it asks the students to consider our work as engineers and data scientists in relation to a broader societal context.  

The task is assigned in the hope that it provides a model by which students can continue to engage with the larger implications of their work, in their role as engineers and as citizens.  

**Written Assignment**

1. Read Bergstrom & West 2020

2. Identify a published research paper relevant to this class, where you think that either the conclusions, or the resulting coverage, qualify as BS.  Using the skills identified in the book, explain A) why they qualify as BS, B) a more appropriate interpretation of the data.

3. Using the skills identified in the book, identify a published research paper that you believe is mostly correct, but has been unfairly labeled or nitpicked.  Explain: A) why it is mostly correct, B) why the criticism is overblown.  

4. Explain how to tell the difference. 

If you are struggling to find a published research paper that qualifies, I am open to a technical report, or science-focused news article as a substitute.  

There is no specific length requirement for the written portion of the assignment.  I'm primarily interested in the strength of the argument.  I do recommend that you come prepared to the class exercise with a set of bullet points summarizing 2, 3 and 4 so you can quickly explain to the class your arguments.


**Class Exercise**

On the date noted above, we as a group complete a class exercise:

1. Each student will take ~3 minutes to describe one of their two articles.  They will not comment on whether it qualifies as BS or not, and simply focus on reporting it clearly.  It is your choice which of your two articles you pick, but don't tell anyone!

2. After each student has presented their article, the class as a whole must work to categorize each article as BS or not BS.  The class must also explain the criteria they used to categorize each.  

It is up to you to determine how you will use to work together as a group--consensus, voting, loudest voice, etc. The class score will be determined by the total number of correctly categorized answers, and the quality of the justifications.

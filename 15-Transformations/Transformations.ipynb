    "## Transformations in Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression assumes that the dependent variables and its predictors are linearly related to each other.  This applies to the terms you specify in the model estimation.  However, you can apply transformations to those variables before estimating the models.  Transformations can be applied to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Just the dependent variable\n",
    "- One or more predictor variables\n",
    "- Both predictor and dependent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common transformations are outlined here:\n",
